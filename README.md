#### Generalist Programmer with a focus on Systems Programming, Graphics, Gameplay, and Networking

Having a passion for game development, programming, and just gaming in general, I am eager to create gaming experiences for people to enjoy and tackle challenging problems as I pursue a BS in Game Programming at Champlain College, as well as a double minor in Mathematics and CSI. I began studying programming in my junior year high school, I am doing my best to be as knowledgeable and confident in the area as I can be. I am also on the Splatoon Esports team for Champlain College and have a fondness for mountain biking, as well as other outdoor activities. Definitely on the lookout for internships in the gaming industry.
